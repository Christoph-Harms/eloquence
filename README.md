Easy and flexible extensions for the Eloquent ORM (Laravel 5+).

Currently available extensions: 

1. `Searchable` query - crazy-simple fulltext search through any related model (based on https://github.com/nicolaslopezj/searchable only written from scratch & greatly improved)
1. `Validable` - self-validating models
2. `Mappable` -map attributes to table fields and/or related models
3. `Metable` - meta attributes made easy
4. `Mutable` - flexible attribute get/set mutators with quick setup (with help of [Romain Lanz](https://github.com/RomainLanz))
5. `Mutator` - pipe-based mutating

**Check the [documentation](https://github.com/jarektkaczyk/eloquence/wiki) for installation and usage info.**
